14	Formation of contract
14.1	The information set out in these Terms of Use or in our Platform do not constitute an offer for sale but rather an invitation to treat.

14.5	Notwithstanding Clause 14.4, prior to the dispatch of the Product or performance of the Services, you may request to cancel or amend the Order by written notice to cs@foreseers.com, which we or the Provider will endeavour to give effect to on a commercially reasonable effort basis. However, we or the Provider is not obliged to give effect to any request to cancel or amend any Order. If the Products have already been dispatched, you may not cancel the Order.
